**Description**
A tool for converting PDF files into text. Based on **xpdf** (see: https://www.xpdfreader.com/download.html ).

**Background**
As part of a Secured Globe, Inc. project with Freedom Scientific, Inc., the creators of https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/, and as part of adding support to Albanian, I developed a small tool for converting PDF files into text so another piece of software we develop can convert thousands of e-books in Albanian and using AI techniques, create an optimal list of sentences in the Albanian language that can be recorded and added to the JAWS platform.
